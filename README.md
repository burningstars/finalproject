<h3>Bio...</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Richard Hudson is 41 years old and is  a voice over artist who is from Lancashire originally. He moved to London when he was 19 years old in 1993.He moved to London to study at Queen Mary's University of London. He wanted to explore his sexuality and new London was the place for that. He also wanted to be in London for the music scene that he was into at the time. He is a proud gay. who lived in south of the Thames most of his life and a man who came out at a very early age, especially around his time growing up in northwest England. He granted me a chance to tell his story to the world and hopefully more individuals will come forward to speak about similar situations. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">It is no surprise being gay is has always had negative issues in the past. In recent years, they have decriminalized homosexuality and many countries are adopting same-sex marriage laws. In today’s’ current time, people are still being victimized for being gay. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Many openly gay men have faced some kind of homophobic abuse or attack during their lifetime. It is very tough if certain communities are not used to this kind of view on life. Many people view the Bible as way to discriminate against homosexuals, which can cause emotional and physical abuse.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Many countries are protecting homosexuals with civil right laws, but what can we learn from recent data of LGBT attacks in London and dangerous areas to be “gay”? I have acquired data in the last two years of reported homophobic attacks in the South London Boroughs. Below is the data shown in two separate pie graphs. </span></p>

Here is some data gathered to show homophobic attacks in South London in 2013 and to compare and contrast this information of attacks in 2014.There are twelve boroughs in south London and  it is represented in two pie graphs to show the differences throughout the following year. Using data gathered by the Met Police, I was able to manipulate the data to show what areas are quite dangerous for LGBT victims.

<h3>Attacks in 2013</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In the 2013 data there was 684 homophobic attacks reported in that year. The most concerning is the Lambeth borough which had approximately 108 homophobic crimes reported, which is worrisome.  The lowest out of all the boroughs was Kingston Upon Thames, which only had 5 attacks in 2013. The average mean for homophobic attack in the 12 boroughs were about 57 attacks each month. </span></p>

<h3>Attacks in 2014</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In the 2014 data, we saw small differences in data of attacks in south London. There were 532 homophobic crimes in that year. In London Boroughs like Sutton and Wandsworth had little to no change. Sutton stayed exactly the same with 12 attacks and  Wandsworth gaining one more attack compared to 2013 at 34. Lambeth saw a small decline of attacks with 91 that year. An area that saw a spike in attacks was Lewisham with 69 during the time.</span></p>

<h3>Differences...?!?</h3>
<span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: medium;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">From the comparisons of each pie graph we can see there was a decline in homophobic attacks in south London by 152 crimes. This is a positive outlook because of recently passed measures to protect homosexuals and them being allowed to marry. Some of the boroughs that had interesting changes were Kingston Upon Thames.  Attacks basically doubled in 2014 by 6 attacks, which saw an 120% </span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="line-height: 18.399999618530273px;">increase. Bromley</span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: medium;"><span style="line-height: 115%;"> saw a 50% decline in attacks from 34 in 2013 to 17 in 2014 and Lewisham went from 32 attacks in 2013 to 69 with a jump of 115.6%.</span></span>

<h1 id="pce_chart1"> <strong>Verdict</strong></h1>
I can conclude from the data that homophobic attacks are occurring less frequently than the previous year. This data has also helped the ability of highlighting areas where its dangerous to be part of the LGBT community. A borough you will need to be careful in is Lambeth especially the amount of homophobic crimes occur every year there. An area which seems quite safe for homosexuals is Kingston Upon Thames. The borough as an extremely low amount of crime relating to gay individuals. LGBT Victims like Richard, hopes that these attacks completely stop.
